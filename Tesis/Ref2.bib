In this document, we focus on the {\textless}i{\textgreater}technical part{\textless}/i{\textgreater} of EWS, i.e. the prediction and timely recognition of imminent hazards, as well as on monitoring slopes at risk and released mass movements. Recent innovations in assessing spatial precipitation, as well as monitoring and modelling precursors, the triggering and deformation of RMM offer new opportunities for next-generation EWS. However, technical advancement can only be transferred into more reliable, operational EWS with an intense dialog between scientists, engineers and those in charge of warning. To this end, further experience with new comprehensive prototype systems jointly operated by scientists and practitioners will be essential.},

	Abstract = {Avalanche risk management is strongly related to the ability to identify and timely report the occurrence of snow avalanches. Infrasound has been applied to avalanche research and monitoring for the last 20 Years but it never turned into an operational tool for the ambiguity to identify clear signals related to avalanches. We present here a new method based on the analysis of infrasound signals recorded by a small aperture array in Ischgl (Austria), which overcome now this limit. The method is based on array derived wave parameters, such as back-azimuth and apparent velocity. The method defines threshold criteria for automatic avalanche identification considering avalanches as a moving source of infrasound. We validate efficiency of the automatic infrasound detection with continuous observations with Doppler Radar and we show how dynamics parameters such as the velocity of a snow avalanche in any given path around the array can be efficiently derived. Our results indicate that a proper infrasound array analysis allows a robust, real-time, remote detection of snow avalanches that could thus contribute significantly to avalanche forecast and risk management.},

We then use snow data from 7 snow stations in Abruzzo (75 equivalent Years of data) to tune a regionally valid distribution of {\textless}i{\textgreater}h{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}72{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}. We then calculate the 30-Years, 100-Years, and 300-Years runout zone and flow pressures, including confidence limits. We demonstrate that (i) properly tuned 1D/quasi2D models can be used for avalanche modeling even within poorly monitored area as here, and (ii) the use of regional analysis allows hazard mapping for large return periods, reducing greatly the uncertainty against canonical, single site analysis. Our approach is usable in poorly monitored regions like Abruzzo here, and we suggest that (i) avalanche hazard mapping needs to be pursued with regional approaches for {\textless}i{\textgreater}h{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}72{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, and (ii) confidence limits need to be provided for the proposed zoning.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Our aim is to analyse such processes with a particular focus on the potential driving factors associated to the soil conditions. We equipped two experimental test sites in Aosta Valley Region (NW-Italy) with glide-snow shoes, temperature and Volumetric liquid water content (VLWC) sensors in the soil and in the basal snowpack layer; snow and weather parameters were also collected by automatic weather stations and in manual snow measuring sites. In the two monitoring seasons 2013{\&}ndash;14 and 2014{\&}ndash;15 we registered 9 glide snow avalanches: 2 cold and 7 warm-temperature events, which were characterized by different snow and soil parameters. In the only warm glide snow avalanche event, which presented a continuous gliding before, the daily glide rate showed a significant exponential relationship with the soil VLWC. We also found, though without a general trend, that gliding and non-gliding periods (either considering warm and cold periods separately or together) were characterized by significantly different predisposing factors. This study contributes to assess the importance of soil VLWC, which seems to be one of the most important driving factors for gliding processes. Therefore, it supports the need, already suggested by other scientists, of analysing such processes with an interdisciplinary approach which integrates snow and soil sciences.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	Abstract = {Seismic methods used in the study of snow avalanches may be employed to detect and characterize landslides and other mass movements, using standard spectrogram/sonogram analysis. For snow avalanches, the spectrogram for a station that is approached by a sliding mass exhibits a triangular time/frequency signature due to an increase over time in the higher-frequency constituents. Recognition of this characteristic footprint in a spectrogram suggests a useful metric for identifying other massmovement events such as landslides. The I June 2005 slide at Laguna Beach, California is examined using data obtained from the Caltech/USGS Regional Seismic Network. This event exhibits the same general spectrogram features observed in studies of Alpine snow avalanches. We propose that these features are due to the systematic relative increase in high-frequency energy transmitted to a seismometer in the path of a mass slide owing to a reduction of distance from the source signal. This phenomenon is related to the path of the waves whose high frequencies are less attenuated as they traverse shorter source-receiver paths. Entrainment of material in the course of the slide may also contribute to the triangular time/frequency signature as a consequence of the increase in the energy involved in the process; in this case the contribution would be a source effect. By applying this commonly observed characteristic to routine monitoring algorithms, along with custom adjustments for local site effects, we seek to contribute to the improvement in automatic detection and monitoring methods of landslides and other mass movements.},

Here we demonstrate that similar techniques can also be applied to regional seismic networks, which show great potential for real-time and large-scale monitoring and analysis of rockslide activity.

We develop a simple and fully automatic processing chain that detects, locates, and classifies rockslides based on vertical-component seismic records. We show that a kurtosis-based onset picker is suitable to detect the very emergent onsets of rockslide signals and to locate the rockslides within a few kilometers from the true origin using a grid search and a 1-D seismic velocity model. Automatic discrimination between rockslides and local earthquakes is possible by a combination of characteristic parameters extracted from the seismic records, such as kurtosis or maximum-to-mean amplitude ratios. We attempt to relate the amplitude of the seismic records to the documented rockslide Volume and reveal a potential power law in agreement with earlier studies. Since our approach is based on simplified methods we suggest and discuss how each step of the automatic processing could be expanded and improved to achieve more detailed results in the future.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We propose a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that addresses this problem by learning a correspondence between common object appearances (e.g. pedestrian, background, tree, etc.) and their associated motions. Our model is designed as a combination of a reconstruction network and an image translation model that share the same encoder. The former sub-network determines the most significant structures that appear in video frames and the latter one attempts to associate motion templates to such structures. The training stage is performed using only videos of normal events and the model is then capable to estimate frame-level scores for an unknown input. The experiments on 6 benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed approach with respect to state-of-the-art methods.},

The insight that motivates this study is that the normal samples can be associated with at least one Gaussian component of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), while anomalies either do not belong to any Gaussian component. The method is based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder, which can learn feature representations of the normal samples as a Gaussian Mixture Model trained using deep learning. A Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) that does not contain a fully-connected layer is employed for the encoder-decoder structure to preserve relative spatial coordinates between the input image and the output feature map. Based on the joint probabilities of each of the Gaussian mixture components, we introduce a sample energy based method to score the anomaly of image test patches. A two-stream network framework is employed to combine the appearance and motion anomalies, using RGB frames for the former and dynamic flow images, for the latter. We test our approach on two popular benchmarks (UCSD Dataset and Avenue Dataset). The experimental results verify the superiority of our method compared to the state of the arts.},

	Abstract = {Snow avalanches generate seismic signals as many other mass movements. Detection of avalanches by seismic monitoring is highly relevant to assess avalanche danger. In contrast to other seismic events, signals generated by avalanches do not have a characteristic first arrival nor is it possible to detect different wave phases. In addition, the moving source character of avalanches increases the intricacy of the signals. Although it is possible to visually detect seismic signals produced by avalanches, reliable automatic detection methods for all types of avalanches do not exist yet. We therefore evaluate whether hidden Markov models (HMMs) are suitable for the automatic detection of avalanches in continuous seismic data. We analyzed data recorded during the winter season 2010 by a seismic array deployed in an avalanche starting zone above Davos, Switzerland. We first visually inspected the data and identified more than 200 events we assume to be generated by avalanches. Since most of the data consists of noise we first applied a simple amplitude threshold to reduce the amount of data. As first classification results were unsatisfying, we analyzed the temporal behaviour of the seismic signals for the whole data set and found that there is a high variability in the seismic signals. We therefore applied further post-processing steps to reduce the Number of false alarms by defining a minimal duration for the detected event, implementing a voting based approach and analyzing the coherence of the detected events. We obtained the best classification results for events detected by at least 5 sensors and with a minimal duration of 12{\&}thinsp;s. These processing steps allowed identifying two known periods of high avalanche activity, suggesting that HMMs are suitable for the automatic detection of avalanches in seismic data. However our results also showed that more sensitive sensors and more appropriate sensor locations are needed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the signals and therefore the classification.},

	Abstract = {Gravitational natural hazards such as snow avalanches, rockfalls, shallow landslides and volcanic activity represent a risk factor for mountain communities around the world. In particular where documentary records about these processes are rare, decisions on risk management and land-use planning have to be based on a variety of other sources including vegetation and tree-ring data and natural hazard process models. We used a combination of these methods in order to evaluate dynamics of snow avalanches and other natural hazards at Valle de las Trancas, in the Biob{\'{i}}o Region in Chile. Along this valley, natural hazards threaten not only the local human population, but also the numerous tourists attracted by outdoor recreational activities. Given the regional scarcity of documentary records, tree-ring methods were applied in order to reconstruct the local history of snow avalanches and debris flow events, which are the more important weather-related processes at respective tracks. A recent version of the model Rapid Mass MovementS (RAMMS), that includes influences of forest structure, was used to calculate different avalanche parameters such as runout distances and maximum pressures, taking into consideration the presence/absence of forest along the tracks as well as different modelled return periods. Our results show that local Nothofagus broadleaved forests contribute to a reduction of avalanche runout distances as well as impact pressures on present infrastructure, thus constituting a valuable ecosystem disaster risk reduction measure that can substitute or complement other traditional measures such as sheds.},

	Abstract = {Uniform spherical beads were used to explore the behavior of a granular system near its critical angle of repose on a conical bead pile. We found two tuning parameters that could take the system to a critical point where a simple power-law described the avalanche size distribution as predicted by self-organized criticality, which proposed that complex dynamical systems self-organize to a critical point without need for tuning. Our distributions were well described by a simple power-law with the power {\{}$\backslash$tau{\}} = 1.5 when dropping beads slowly onto the apex of a bead pile from a small height. However, we could also move the system from the critical point using either of two tuning parameters: the height from which the beads fell onto the top of the pile or the region over which the beads struck the pile. As the drop height increased, the system did not reach the critical point yet the resulting distributions were independent of the bead mass, coefficient of friction, or coefficient of restitution. All our apex-dropping distributions for any type of bead (glass, stainless steel, zirconium) showed universality by scaling onto a common curve with {\{}$\backslash$tau{\}} = 1.5 and {\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}} = 1.0, where 1/{\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}} is the power of the tuning parameter. From independent calculations using the moments of the distribution, we find values for {\{}$\backslash$tau{\}} = 1.6 $\backslash$pm 1.0 and {\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}} = 0.91 $\backslash$pm 0.15. When beads were dropped across the surface of the pile instead of solely on the apex, then the system also moved from the critical point and again the avalanche size distributions fell on a common curve when scaled similarly using the same values of {\{}$\backslash$tau{\}} and {\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}}. We also observed that an hcp structure on the base of the pile caused an emergent structure in the pile that had six faces with some fcc or hcp structure.},

In this paper we revisit the popular performance measures and tracker performance visualizations and analyze them theoretically and experimentally. We show that several measures are equivalent from the point of information they provide for tracker comparison and, crucially, that some are more brittle than the others. Based on our analysis we narrow down the set of potential measures to only two complementary ones, describing accuracy and robustness, thus pushing towards homogenization of the tracker evaluation methodology. These two measures can be intuitively interpreted and visualized and have been employed by the recent Visual Object Tracking (VOT) challenges as the foundation for the evaluation methodology.},

Particularly a lot of catastrophes such as tsunami, volcano, and terrorism cause huge casualty and property loss. In this paper, we concentrate on the smoke detection system in video for early fire alarming. The proposed block-based smoke detection algorithm consists of three basic steps, which has simple operation and provides good performance. In the first step, we discover motion vector utilizing several motion estimation schemes and discern the suspect as smoke region. This process does not require huge computational cost because of using the H.264/AVC during the recoding in DVR system. In the second step, we conduct block based chromatic detection. In the third step, we employ motion information for detecting the correct smoke block by using the characteristics that smoke goes almost upward. Experimental results provide that the proposed method gives good performance for real smoke detection. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Snow avalanches pose serious threat to Indian troops deployed in snow-bound areas of western Himalaya during winter months. The most viable way to mitigate avalanche threat in these areas is to precisely predict the time and place of their occurrences. Since, the factors involved in the formation of an avalanche are too many and underlying physical processes are quite complex, no prediction model can completely imitate the thought process and analysis methods of an expert forecaster. However, with the recent developments in the field of computational capabilities and Artificial Intelligence, improved models are coming up and proving to be reliable assistant to avalanche forecasters. In this direction, an attempt has been made to exploit the technique of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The base model is inspired by the popular non-parametric k-Nearest Neighbours method, where the two-parameter output is processed through ANN for classification. The model has been tested for an avalanche prone sector of Kashmir region and results are quite satisfactory. The paper discusses in detail the overall methodology adopted in the development of present model, and test results observed. Further possible use of Artificial Intelligence techniques in avalanche forecasting has also been discussed.},

	Abstract = {Detailed data on autumn, winter and spring snow-cover conditions from remote areas are often difficult or very expensive to obtain. Therefore, an inexpensive method of digital photography was tested in high-Arctic Greenland. Automatic digital photography has provided daily data on snow distribution and snow depth for {\textgreater} 1 year from the Zackenberg area (74°30' N) in northeast Greenland. A standard digital hand-held camera (Kodak Digital Science DC50) was equipped to become automatic; it is supplied with an “automatic finger” and an external power supply and built into a protecting box with additional solar panels on top, in order to secure continuous operation throughout the year. The daily photograph covers a 100 m transect through a seasonal snowpatch, and thus on an annual basis also yields information on snow-cover duration in the different vegetation zones of the snowpatch. The camera was installed in mid-August 1998. Photographs from the period mid-August 1998 to early September 1999 were collected and analyzed. All photos are taken at astronomic noon in order to use the daylight as long as possible into the winter season before the 24 h winter darkness begins in mid-November.The digital photographs yielded the following information for the year 1998/99: The first winter snowfall occurred on 18 October; small-scale snow redistribution by snow-drifting started when the winter snow cover was about 5 cm thick. The continuous winter snow cover lasted for a minimum of 170 days in the most snow-deprived areas downwind of the snowpatch, whereas snow in the centre of the snowpatch stayed on the ground for {\textgreater} 325 days, turning the snowpatch perennial in summer 1999. Meteorological data obtained close to the photographed snowpatch site, in combination with the snow-cover depth and distribution data derived from the photographs, show that at wind speeds (at 2 m height) of up to around 6 m s −1 , only small-scale snow-drifting took place, when the snow cover was thin. Intense snowdrifting, however, took place at wind speeds of 8–13 m s −1 , particularly when enough snow was available in the upwind area. The automatic continuous photography technique demonstrated here could be particularly useful in remote areas at high risk of avalanches during winter. It is an alternative to traditional snow monitoring achieved mainly by sonic sensors, snow pillows or manual measurements of snow depths Likewise, it can provide better areal information than most standard methods, which give only point measurements. },

	abstract = {The road along the {\'{O}}shl{\'{i}}ð hillside in the West Fjords region of Iceland is one of the most hazardous roads in Iceland due to avalanches, rockfalls and debris flows. The road has little traffic, but nevertheless traffic accidents caused by the severe conditions at the site are common. A number of avalanche tracks are found on the hillside. In some of these tracks, avalanches occur more frequently than in others. When there is an avalanche threat, avalanches generally flow over many tracks in a short time. Monitoring vibrations in the tracks with the highest avalanche frequency can indicate when avalanches start flowing down the hillside in a snowstorm, and avalanche hazard can then be declared with the specific site indicated. The same methodology can be used for rockfalls and debris flows, which are strongly affected by weather conditions and typically occur in clusters. Based on this knowledge, a research project was initiated in February 1996 with the objective of developing an automatic system based on seismic measurements to detect and analyze avalanches on the {\'{O}}shl{\'{i}}ð hillside and to instantly send a warning to a control station.},

Traditional field-based methods are too time and cost consuming and limited to good visibility and accessible terrain. Different remote sensing methods have been proposed to assist in monitoring of snow avalanche activity, with satellite-borne radar remote sensing allowing for all-weather and all-light conditions monitoring. Here we present a complete, two-year snow avalanche activity record from a Norwegian forecasting region using Sentinel-1A radar satellite imagery. We used a change detection method to manually identify avalanche debris based on localized backscatter increase in avalanche runout zones and assess these detections using multi-temporal and multi-sensor datasets. We then used the complete dataset of snow avalanche activity to exemplify different applications from validating issued avalanche bulletins, to generating avalanche path maps, and creating a snow climate classification. Comparing manual identification in Sentinel-1A images and a very high resolution Radarsat-2 image suggest overall underestimation of avalanche activity, also when considering the non-detectability of small avalanche debris. We foresee that with the further increase in satellite-radar data availability and the improvement of automatized snow avalanche detection, the presented methodologies will be able to assist in operational avalanche forecasting worldwide in the near future.},

	abstract = {Snow avalanches are among the most destructive natural hazards threatening human life, ecosystems, built structures, and landscapes in mountainous regions. The complexity of snow avalanche modelling has been discussed in many studies, but its modelling is not well-documented. Snow avalanche modeling in this study was done using three main categories of data, including avalanche occurrence locations, meteorological factors, and terrain characteristics. Two machine learning models, namely support vector machine (SVM) and multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA), were employed. A ratio of 70 to 30 of data was considered for calibrating and validating the models. Results indicated that both models had an excellent performance in snow avalanche modeling (area under curve, AUC {\textgreater} 90), although hits and misses analysis demonstrated the superior performance of MDA. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the topographic position index, slope, precipitation, and topographic wetness index were the most effective variables for modeling. A snow avalanche map indicated that the high snow avalanche hazard zone was mostly near the streams and was matched with hillsides around the water pathways. Findings of study can be helpful for land use planning, to control snow avalanche paths, and to prevent the probable hazards induced by it, and it can be a good reference for future studies on modeling snow avalanche hazards.},

	abstract = {Avalanche activity data represent the most direct instability data for avalanche forecasting. Yet, avalanche observations are notoriously incomplete. With remote avalanche detection methods this deficiency might be overcome. We used a geophone buried in the snowpack to monitor avalanche activity. Contrary to previous studies we inserted the geophone directly in an avalanche start zone, allowing for the detection of substantially smaller avalanches, including loose snow avalanches. The observed patterns in the signals generated by different types of avalanches qualitatively confirmed previous work. By visually analyzing the spectrogram of the seismic data, over 380 avalanches were identified during the winter of 2010 over an area of about 2km 2. Avalanche activity was also monitored with two automatic cameras. Avalanche activity data obtained from the seismic sensor and from automatic cameras were in good agreement. Our field observations suggest that slab avalanches were better detected than loose snow avalanches. The relation between avalanche activity and meteorological data were in line with commonly followed rules in avalanche forecasting. Our results confirm that avalanche detection using seismic methods can provide reliable avalanche activity data for avalanche forecasting. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Automated detection of snow avalanches is crucial to assess the effectiveness of avalanche control by explosions, and to monitor avalanche activity in a given area in view of avalanche forecasting. Several automated or semi-automated detection technologies have been developed in the past among which infrasound-based detection is the most promising for regional-scale avalanche monitoring. However, due to significant ambient noise content in infrasonic signals, e.g. from atmospheric processes or airplanes, fully automated and reliable avalanche detection has been very challenging. Signal processing is highly critical and strongly affects detection accuracy. Here, a robust detection method by using supervised machine learning is introduced. Machine learning algorithms can take into account multiple signal features and statistically optimize the classification task. We analyzed infrasound data with concurrent visual avalanche observations from the test site Lavin (Eastern Swiss Alps) for the winter of 2011-2012. A support vector machine was trained by using training data from the first half of the winter season and the accuracy was tested on data from the second half of the season. A significant reduction of false detections, from 65{\%} to 10{\%}, was achieved compared to a threshold-based classifier provided by the sensor manufacturer. The proposed method enables reliable assessment of the avalanche activity in the surroundings of the system and paves the way towards robust and fully automated avalanche detection using infrasonic systems.},

	abstract = {Snow avalanches cause significant loss of life and infrastructure in snow covered mountain areas worldwide. Our understanding and ability to forecast avalanche activity in space and time, are limited by incomplete avalanche activity datasets, derived from point-scale field observations. Here we propose the use of C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) in detecting avalanche debris. We use high-resolution Radarsat-2 Ultrafine (RS-2U) imagery to manually detect avalanche debris-like features based on the backscatter contrast between avalanche debris and the surrounding, undisturbed snowpack. During March 2014, we acquired 12 RS-2U images, covering roughly 12{\%} of the county of Troms in Northern Norway. Using single backscatter images, we detected 546 avalanche debris-like features of which 57 overlapped in multiple times, 7 were either radar shadows and layovers or natural features, and 15 were eliminated by a topographic GIS model, distinguishing avalanche from non-avalanche terrain. The remaining 467 features were classified as avalanche debris, of which 173 features (37{\%}) could be validated. Validation was carried out in the field, by using optical remote sensing data from Landsat-8, by compiling SAR change detection images and by independent manual expert detection. SAR change detection utilizes the relative backscatter increase of avalanche debris between a snow-free SAR image and a current SAR image with avalanche activity. This relative backscatter increase was quantified with a median relative backscatter of 3.7. dB, and a threshold of 1.5. dB. In this study, we showed that detection of small sized avalanche debris is possible using RS-2U images. However, the operational usage is limited by the high acquisition costs, small ground swath, and uncertain data availability.},

	abstract = {To improve our understanding of avalanche release processes, more accurate avalanche activity data are required. Usually, data on avalanche occurrences are obtained through visual observations from valley bottom at regular time intervals, for instance twice a day. Visual observations are not possible during periods of poor visibility, in remote locations or in hazardous situations. This results in inaccurate data and a bias towards larger avalanches, as these are more easily observed. To overcome these limitations, several remote avalanche detection methods, such as seismic or infrasonic monitoring have been developed. However, these methods can be relatively expensive and have not yet reached a level of reliability required for operational use. We propose a simple alternative using time-lapse photography. Time-lapse photography is a nonintrusive, inexpensive and safe technique that can be used to observe avalanche activity across large areas. It can also be used to measure changes in snow movement and deformation. We have used time-lapse photography to improve glide-snow avalanche forecasting by monitoring glide crack expansion. By counting the number of dark pixels in an area around a glide crack, changes in glide rates are measured. Our results show that time-lapse photography can be used to monitor snow glide rates simultaneously in several start zones and potentially provide insight into when, or if, a glide-snow avalanche will release. We have also used time-lapse photography to better understand processes involved in wet-snow avalanche release, by correlating avalanche occurrences with local meteorological data. Results show that onset of wet-snow avalanching typically occurs during the first period of prolonged above freezing temperatures. Furthermore, there typically is a lag of a few hours between the rise in snow surface temperature and the onset of avalanching. Overall, our results show that time-lapse photography can be used to improve our understanding of processes involved in avalanche formation, and ultimately, improve their forecasting.},

@article{Herwijnen2012,
	abstract = {During the winter 2011-2012, the Swiss Alps experienced a high glide snow activity. Glide cracks and glide avalanches presented a great concern for avalanche safety programs as they are difficult to forecast. Furthermore, glide cracks are difficult to control with explosives. A clear relationship between meteorological parameters, terrain characteristics and snow cover evolution could not be established to explain glide snow activity. It's believed that presence of free water at the snow-soil interface could best explain fluctuations in glide velocities. As snow gliding activity is strongly related to glide avalanche release, it was suggested that glide rates monitoring could help forecasting glide avalanche triggering. Based on these assumptions, periods of glide crack activity were compared with meteorological and snow cover variables, with the goal to improve our understanding of snow gliding processes. Since the winter 2008-2009, glide snow activity is monitored at two sites near Davos, Easter Swiss Alps, using time-lapse photography. Previous studies relied on a method based on dark pixel count to quantify the expansion of glide cracks over time. This method was evaluated and improved in order to obtain glide cracks values from the images. Periods of snow gliding activity and interesting glide cracks were identified in the time-lapse data base. 18 glide avalanches and 26 glide cracks were selected and analyzed. Numerical snow cover simulations were performed using the SNOWPACK model to link glide crack expansion with meteorological and snow cover variables. Results showed that no clear diurnal variation of glide snow avalanche could be identified during winter time, when the snow cover is cold and dry. During spring time, when the snow cover is wet and warm, most glide snow avalanches occurred at noon. Observed time lag between the glide crack formation and the glide snow avalanche was larger during wintertime than during springtime. Cracks that did not result in an avalanche showed linear opening rates and cracks resulting in avalanches showed periods of stagnation in glide rates before the avalanche release. Most relevant weather parameters for the analysis of glide rates were snow surface temperature, air temperature and 3 days sum of new snow. Most relevant snow cover parameters were liquid water content and internal energy. Results revealed that snow gliding seems to be mostly driven by high liquid water content, positive air temperature and snow surface temperature close to zero degrees. If these parameters recover normal values, the glide process usually doesn't develop into an avalanche. Results may be specific to the investigated area, but especially the analysis of meteorological and snowpack variables combined with high temporal resolution glide rates shows promising outlook in developing practical forecasting tools.},
